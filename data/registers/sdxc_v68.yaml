Timer units are clock periods of the clock whose frequency is specified in the Internal Timer Clock Frequency field CQCAP register. The minimum value is 0001h (1 clock period) and the maximum value is FFFFh (65535 clock periods). For example, a CQCAP field value of 0 indicates a 19.2 MHz clock frequency (period = 52.08 ns). If the setting in CQSSC1.CIT is 1000h, the calculated polling period is 4096*52.08 ns= 213.33 us. Should be programmed only when CQCFG.CQ_EN is '0'.

Host Controller can continue data transfer even after this reset is executed while handling subcommand-response errors. The following registers and bits are cleared by this bit: Present State register : Command Inhibit (CMD) bit Normal Interrupt Status register : Command Complete bit Error Interrupt Status : Response error statuses related to Command Inhibit (CMD) bit Values: 0x0 (FALSE): Work 0x1 (TRUE): Reset."
