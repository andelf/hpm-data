In the full-duplex mode, this bit should be read as 1'b0 before writing to the Flow Control register. To initiate a Pause frame, the Application must set this bit to 1'b1. During a transfer of the Control Frame, this bit continues to be set to signify that a frame transmission is in progress. After the completion of Pause frame transmission, the MAC resets this bit to 1'b0. The Flow Control register should not be written to until this bit is cleared. In the half-duplex mode, when this bit is set (and TFE is set), then backpressure is asserted by the MAC.

Similarly for a read operation, the contents of Register 5 are not valid until this bit is cleared. The subsequent read or write operation should happen only after the previous operation is complete.

If the LPITXA and LPIEN bits are set to 1, the MAC enters the LPI mode only after all outstanding frames (in the core) and pending frames (in the application interface) have been transmitted. The MAC comes out of the LPI mode when the application sends any frame for transmission or the application issues a TX FIFO Flush command. In addition, the MAC automatically clears the LPIEN bit when it exits the LPI state. If TX FIFO Flush is set in Bit 20 of Register 6 (Operation Mode Register), when the MAC is in the LPI mode, the MAC exits the LPI mode.

      description: Deferral Check When this bit is set, the deferral check function is enabled in the MAC. The MAC issues a Frame Abort status, along with the excessive deferral error bit set in the transmit frame status, when the transmit state machine is deferred for more than 24,288 bit times in the 10 or 100 Mbps mode. If the MAC is configured for 1000 Mbps operation or if the Jumbo frame mode is enabled in the 10 or 100 Mbps mode, the threshold for deferral is 155,680 bits times. Deferral begins when the transmitter is ready to transmit, but it is prevented because of an active carrier sense signal (CRS) on GMII or MII. The defer time is not cumulative. For example, if the transmitter defers for 10,000 bit times because the CRS signal is active and then the CRS signal becomes inactive, the transmitter transmits and collision happens. Because of collision, the transmitter needs to back off and then defer again after back off completion. In such a scenario, the deferral timer is reset to 0 and it is restarted.

      description: Sub-second Increment Value The value programmed in this field is accumulated every clock cycle (of clk_ptp_i) with the contents of the sub-second register. For example, when PTP clock is 50 MHz (period is 20 ns), you should program 20 (0x14) when the System Time- Nanoseconds register has an accuracy of 1 ns [Bit 9 (TSCTRLSSR) is set in Register 448 (Timestamp Control Register)]. When TSCTRLSSR is clear, the Nanoseconds register has a resolution of ~0.465ns. In this case, you should program a value of 43 (0x2B) that is derived by 20ns/0.465.
