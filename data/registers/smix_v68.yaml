      description: "The modes are: Mode 0: Disabled: after reset. Program the registers, and DSTx_SRC_EN[n] to enter Mode 1. Mode 1: Enabled but not activated: After Enabled. Data needed signal can send out, can receive DMA data. Will enter Mode 2 after manual ACT or Fade-in CMD Mode 2: Enabled and activated and buffer feed-in in progress: Can not be fade out. Will consume data from DMA. If not enter due to Fade-in CMD, will enter Mode 4, else enter Mode 3. This mode is used to make the channel in MIX only after initial data are ready, thus will not stall mix operation due to the lackness of data of this channel omly. Mode 3: Enabled and activated and fade-in in progress: Can not be fade out. Will consume data from DMA. Mode 4: Enabled and activated and done fade-in, no fade-out yet: Can be fade out. Will consume data from DMA. Mode 5: Enabled and activated and fade-out in progress: After faded out done. Will consume data from DMA. Will transfer to mode 6 or mode 7 depending on the SRCn_CTRL[AutoDeactAfterFadeOut_En] cfg Mode 6: Enabled and activated and faded-out: faded out is done. Will consume data from DMA. Will transfer to mode 7 if manual deactivated. Mode 7: Enabled and De-activated: If configured to enter this mode, after auto or manuallly fade-out, or after manual de-activated. Won't consume data from DMA. Won't gen data needed signals. Intf register can be programmed. Will change to Mode 2 after manual ACT or Fade-in CMD. Will transfer to Mode 0 if DSTx_SRC_EN[n] is assigned 0. To support a new stream or, to continue the old stream after a pause."
