Bit RESET forces several components to a reset state. RESET is automatically set if the node enters “bus off” state. Note that a CAN node will participate in CAN communication after RESET is switched to 0after 11 CAN bit times. This delay is required by the CAN standard (bus idle time).If RESET is set to 1 and immediately set to 0, then it takes some time until RESET can beread as 0 and becomes inactive. The reason is clock domain crossing from host to CAN clockdomain. RESET is held active as long as needed depending on the relation between host andCAN clock.

Then the CAN-CTRL core connects the TBUF registers to the next slot. Once a slot is marked as filled a transmission can be started using TSONE or TSALL. It is possible to set TSNEXT and TSONE or TSALL together in one write access. TSNEXT has to be set by the host controller and is automatically reset by the CAN-CTRL core immediately after it was set. Setting TSNEXT is meaningless if TBSEL=0. In this case TSNEXT is ignored and automatically cleared. It does not do any harm. If all slots of the STB are filled, TSNEXT stays set until a slot becomes free. TSNEXT has no meaning in TTCAN mode and is fixed to 0.

If REF_IDE is 1 - REF_ID(28:0) is valid (extended ID) 0 - REF_ID(10:0) is valid (standard ID) REF_ID is used in TTCAN mode to detect a reference message. This holds for time slaves (reception) as well as for the time master (transmission). If the reference message is detected and there are no errors, then the Sync_Mark of this frame will become the Ref_Mark. REF_ID(2:0) is not tested and therefore the appropriate register bits are forced to 0. These bits are used for up to 8 potential time masters. CAN-CTRL recognizes the reference message only by ID. The payload is not tested. Additional note: A time master will transmit a reference message in the same way as a normal frame. REF_ID is intended for detection of a successful transmission of a reference message."
