    - name: SHADOW_LOAD_EN
      description: Shadow Load Enable The SHADOW_LOAD_EN bit is written to 1 by software after all DMA control registers are written. If set to 1, shadowed control registers are updated to the active control registers on internal logical VSYNC of next frame. If set to 0, shadowed control registers are not loaded into the active control registers. The previous active control register settings will be used to process the next frame. Hardware will automatically clear this bit, when the shadow registers are loaded to the active control regsisters.

Abort is generated when the LCDC is going to switch bank to a new bank, and the new bank data is not ready yet. Abort is only useful when communicating with the offline calculator (such as PDMA as the active pixel generator mode). PDMA as the active generator mode, means it is the first pixel generator with data sources from offline memory, and not from on-the-fly streaming data (such as camera captured data). While with on-the-fly streaming data, error condition is indicated by display buffer underflow."
